Mini challenge #6 "Odd or Even"
This project will prompt the user to enter numbers and the console will return if the numbers are even or odd.

Review: Jessie Lamzon
Code runs and provides odd or even results.  I like the error message when i input incorrect characters.  only thing is I able to exit by pressing enter without input and entering random letters allowed to play again. Good Job!
